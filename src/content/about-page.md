# About WhatGov

## Our Mission
To make parliamentary democracy more accessible, understandable, and actionable for organisations in the UK.

## Who We Are

WhatGov was founded in 2024 by a single person passionate about democratic advocacy and its intersection with technology. I believe that understanding Parliament shouldn't require specialist knowledge.

WhatGov is an independent organisation, not affiliated with any political party or government body. My commitment is to transparent, non-partisan information that helps British organisations engage our democracy.
