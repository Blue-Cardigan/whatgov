deprioritize Lords, prioritize bill discussion

Align questions/key points with ideology so users can tag themselves over time

#Optimizations
Don't let key points stretch cards out tall
Load more virtualized debates at once/ slow down scroll/ skeletons 
- problem: looks janky when scrolling fast
Reduce middleware build size for edge runtime
